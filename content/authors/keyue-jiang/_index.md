Hi there! I am a PhD student in Information Engineering and Machine Learning, jointly supervised by [Dr. Laura Toni](https://lasp-ucl.github.io/author/laura-toni/) at University College London and [Dr. Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/) at the University of Oxford. Before that, I obtained my MSc in Data Science at UCL, advised by [Dr. Pasquale Minervini](https://neuralnoise.com/) at [UCL NLP](https://nlp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), and BEng in Ocean Engineering and Technology at Zhejiang University. My research interest lies in the general world of Graph Machine Learning, which includes, Probabilistic Graph Machine Learning, Graph Signal Processing and Knowledge Graphs.
